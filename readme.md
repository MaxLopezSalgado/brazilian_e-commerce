# Customer Geolocation Analysis

*An analysis of customer geolocation data to visualize customer distribution and generate insights.*

## Description

This project focuses on analyzing customer geolocation data from a Kaggle dataset provided by Olist. The mean goal of this Analysis is to gain insights into customer distribution and generate visualizations for better understanding of the information of this Brasilian E-commerce Company. This venture involves cleaning and merging customer data with geolocation data, performing data wrangling tasks, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), plotting customer locations on a map, and creating a heatmap based on customer counts. In the future we could also perform some ML predictions, but for now this exceed the aim of the analysis.

## Data Wrangling and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The project involved data wrangling and exploratory data analysis on the following datasets:

**DataFrame 1: Customer Data**
```python
        # DataFrame 1 Info
        print(customer_df.info())
        # DataFrame 2 Info
        print(order_df.info())
        # DataFrame 3 Info
        print(payment_df.info())
        # DataFrame 4 Info
        print(review_df.info())
        # DataFrame 5 Info
        print(order_details_df.info())
        # DataFrame 6 Info
        print(product_df.info())
        # DataFrame 7 Info
        print(seller_df.info())
        # DataFrame 8 Info
        print(product_category_df.info())
        # DataFrame 9 Info
        print(geolocation_df.info())
